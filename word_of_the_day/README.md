# Word of the Day Program

Here's a program that generates a word of the day and prints it out. How the program and user inputs work are as follows:

* The word will start with a letter corresponding with the day of the month. So the word of the first day of the month should start with "a", then the 2nd is "b", then the 3rd is "c", and so on.
* Once you exhaust all letters, it loop around. So the 26th day of the month starts with "z", then the 27th should start with "a", and continues from there.

The words generated are derived from a text file, compiled of over 100,000 words ranging from letters 'a' to 'z'.
